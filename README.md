## Overview

Ready for a great new book? This app uses google books api along with react and a Mongo database to support any reader in finding their next life changing book. Simply search for aspects of a book you'd like to read, and once the results have been displayed, save the books you'd like to for later reading.

Check out this project deployed to heroku [here](https://reactive-reading.herokuapp.com/)

## Technology-Used

* Node
* Express
* React
* React-Router
* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* Axios

## Challenges

This project went relatively smoothly, with the few problems coming from the relatively little experience I had with React at this point in this course. Other problems occurres with the googlebooks api not interacting well with the map function due to occasionally missing data, which had to be protected against.

## Final-Thoughts

This project was fairly easy, especially as I had worked with google apis on several occasions in the past, and was beginning to become accustomed to react. I did really enjoy creating a library-like app, something I had always wanted to do.




<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
