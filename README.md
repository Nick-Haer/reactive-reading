## Overview

Ready for a great new book? This app uses google books api along with react and a Mongo database to support any reader in finding their next life changing book. Simply search for aspects of a book you'd like to read, and once the results have been displayed, save the books you'd like to for later reading.

## Challenges

This project went relatively smoothly, with the few problems coming from the relatively little experience I had with React at this point in this course. Other problems occurres with the googlebooks api not interacting well with the map function due to occasionally missing data, which had to be protected against.

## Final-Thoughts

This project was fairly easy, especially as I had worked with google apis on several occasions in the past, and was beginning to become accustomed to react. I did really enjoy creating a library-like app, something I had always wanted to do.
